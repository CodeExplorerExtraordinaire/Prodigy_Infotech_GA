# Prodigy_Infotech_GA

Hello everyone,

I have uploaded my generative AI tasks to this repository. These tasks were assigned by Prodigy Infotech as part of their internship program. This internship has provided me with a wonderful opportunity to learn and gain knowledge about generative AI.

Feel free to let me know if you need any further adjustments.

Here are the list of tasks:
#PRODIGY_GA_01: Text Generation with GPT-2
Train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. Starting with GPT-2, a transformer model developed by OpenAI, you will learn how to fine-tune the model on a custom dataset to create text that mimics the style and structure of your training data.
